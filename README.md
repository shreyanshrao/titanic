The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for machine learning and data analysis, containing details about passengers, such as age, class, gender, fare, and whether they survived the disaster. After transforming the dataset, I performed various preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to improve model performance.

Once the dataset was cleaned and transformed, I trained a machine learning model to predict survival. I experimented with different models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to determine which one provided the best accuracy. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model could generalize well to unseen data.

After training the model, I evaluated its performance using accuracy as the primary metric. The modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting whether a passenger was alive (survived) was calculated based on correct predictions versus actual survival outcomes. Depending on the model used and feature engineering techniques, the accuracy varied, but Random Forest generally provided a higher accuracy compared to simpler models.

This analysis helped in understanding the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic, such as gender and passenger class, and improved my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
